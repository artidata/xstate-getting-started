# xstate-getting-started

This is my first step into xstate territory.

[xstate](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate) ability to turn lines of code into flow chart gets me excited into the codeless future of UI dev.

Knowing that the Authenticator component of [amplify-ui](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui) gets me excited even more.

Here's the small step, it won't be complete with its corresponding [statechart](https://stately.ai/viz/fbfd9945-49b5-4231-9607-d1bf64f1cc0b).
